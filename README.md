## Installation Instructions

### Prework for SEGGER J-Link

In order to use and program the Infineon XMC microcontrollers in the Arduino IDE, you need [SEGGER J-Link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) installed on your PC. Please follow this link to [SEGGER J-Link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) and install the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack for your operating system.
If you have already installed '[DAVE™ - Development Platform for XMC™ Microcontrollers](https://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/microcontroller/32-bit-industrial-microcontroller-based-on-arm-registered-cortex-registered-m/dave-version-4-free-development-platform-for-code-generation/channel.html?channel=db3a30433580b37101359f8ee6963814)', you can skip this step as the respective drivers/programs are already installed on your system.

### Important Notes

* This integration will only work for Arduino IDE >=1.5
* The XMC1100 Boot Kit has limitations if compared to the official Arduino boards (consult the [XMC-for-Arduino Wiki](https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino/wiki) for more information)
* Refer also to the LICENSE.md/txt file for further information
* Arduino 1.8.0 IDE might have problems with the XMC-for-Arduino releases
