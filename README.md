## Installation Instructions

### Prework for SEGGER J-Link

In order to use Infineon's XMC microcontroller boards in Arduino you need [SEGGER J-Link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) installed on your machine first. Please follow [this link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink) and install the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack for your respective operating system (OS).

![J-Link](resources/wiki/image/jlink_install.png)

If you are downloading J-Link for the first time, make sure to check this box: Install USB Driver for J-Link.

![J-Link-driver](resources/wiki/image/J-Link_Installer_options_page.png)

### Required tools

XMC-for-Arduino requires Python 3.x and `pyserial`. Make sure Python is installed on your machine and available in the system path.

You can check if it was successfully installed by opening your command line or terminal and typing:
```
  python --version
```
With [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) available, install the mentioned packages from a terminal:

```
  pip install pyserial
```

### Integration in Arduino IDE
Please first download the Arduino IDE. This package is only tested for Arduino IDE >=1.5. We recommended to use Arduino IDE >=2.0.

```

![Adding a Board JSON](resources/wiki/image/preference_JSON.png)

To install the boards, please go now to **Tools** > **Board** > **Boards Manager...** and search for XMC. You will see options to install the board files for the microcontrollers. Click "Install" to add the boards to your Arduino IDE.

![Infineon Board Entry](resources/wiki/image/Boards_Manager_Entry.png)

In the boards list **Tools** > **Board**, you will now find the supported XMC microcontroller boards.

### Notes

* **The differences of the boards included in this repository if compared to the Arduino boards**
* **Refer also to the LICENSE.md/txt file of the repositories for further information**
* **The Boot Kits have limitations if compared to the official Arduino boards (consult the [XMC-for-Arduino Wiki](https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino/wiki) for more information)**
* **XMC-for-Arduino support for 'arm-linux-gnueabihf' only until version 1.1.**


### Release packages from version 3.0.0 onwards

Certain obsolete boards (see wiki) and non-functional libraries were removed from the board support package for the release version 2.0.0, alongwith some other major changes (see release notes). After version 3.0.0, the release index will not include library before version 2.0.0.

### Known Issues

* :warning: While using the pins connected to the **LEDs** configured as **INPUT**, there might be some abberation in behavior due to the presence of the series resistor of the LED, as it causes a voltage drop on the pin. In case of such an occurance, it is advised to desolder the series resistor and the LED and thereby using the pin as INPUT.
