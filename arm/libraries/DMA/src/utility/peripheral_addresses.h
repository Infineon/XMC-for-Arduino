/**
 * peripheral_addresses.h - Addresses of the peripherals for the XMC microcontrollers
 * Part of: Library for Arduino to control the GPDMA of the XMC4000 series.
 *
 * The General Purposes Direct Memory Access (GPDMA) is a module within the XMC4000 series to transfer data
 * without any CPU interference. When a DMA transfer request is generated, the GPDMA transfers data stored
 * at the source address to the destination address.
 * 
 * Have a look at the application note/reference manual for more information.
