/**
 *  @page The I2S library for XMC
 *  @section introduction Introduction
 * 	The IIS protocol is a synchronous serial communication protocol mainly for audio and infotainment applications. This library allows the microcontroller to work as 
 *  the master device and read audio input from another device such as a microphone.
 *
 *	@section Wiring
 *  The library has been tested with the XMC4700 Relax Kit/XMC1100 XMC2G0/XMC1100 Boot Kit. interfacing an Infineon IM69D130 Microphone Shield2Go. 
 *  For the XMC4700 relax board, following ports should be connected:
 *  LRCL -- 3.10
 *  DOUT -- 3.7
 *  SCLK -- 3.9
 *  GND  -- GND
 *  3.3V -- 3.3V
 *  
 *  For the XMC1100 boards the connection should be the following:
 *  LRCL -- 0.9
 *  DOUT -- 0.6
 *  SCLK -- 0.8
 *  GND  -- GND (VSS)
 *  3.3V -- 3.3V (VDD)
 * 
 *  SCL (for channel selection) on the breakout can be left unconnected if only one microphone is used. 
 *  When 2 microphones are connected, the SCL ports on the microphones should be
 *  pulled low/high respectively for transmission on left/right channels.
 * 
 *
 *	@subsection Implementation
 *  This library uses interrupts to read data from a microphone. The microcontroller generates a WA (word address, or WS for word select) which is output to LRCL port of the microphone.
 *  This signal controls the timing of data transmission. On the rising edge of the WA signal the right channel transmits and on the falling edge the left channel transmits.
 *
