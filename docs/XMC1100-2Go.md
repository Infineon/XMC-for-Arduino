# Overview
This pages summarizes information about the XMC1100 2Go evaluation board and its implementation for the Arduino IDE. The XMC1100 2Go board consists of a XMC1100 microcontroller with a debugger implemented by a XMC4200 microcontroller. The Infineon homepage of the board can be found [here](https://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/evaluation-boards/KIT_XMC_2GO_XMC1100_V1/productType.html?productType=db3a304443537c4e01436ccecb5d154f#ispnTab9).

# Changes
## V1.4.0 Onwards
The release V1.4.0 changed the Arduino pin out: Analog Inputs A0 and A1 have been swapped as part of adding extra 2 Analog Inputs - 
* A0 is now pin 13
* A1 is now pin 12

Additions of extra Analog and PWM channels -

## V1.1.0 Onwards
The release V1.1.0 changed the pin out: MISO and MOSI have been swapped to ensure compatibility with additional existing boards, please compare pin out diagram for changes.
* MISO is now pin 0
* MOSI is now pin 1
