Installation Instructions
===========================

The following step-by-step guide will get you started with XMC for Arduino:

Prework for SEGGER J-Link
------------------------------

In order to use Infineon's XMC microcontroller boards in Arduino you need
`SEGGER J-Link <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink>`_ installed on your machine first. Please follow
`this link <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink>`_ 
and install the *J-Link Software and Documentation Pack* for your respective operating system.

If you are downloading J-Link for the first time, make sure to check the box **Install USB Driver for J-Link**.

Required Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
XMC for Arduino requires *Python 3.x* and *pyserial*. Make sure `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is installed on your machine and available in the system path.

.. note::
    When installing Python on Windows, ensure you check "*Add Python to PATH*" before clicking install.
    This allows XMC for Arduino to find the Python executable.
    
    If you forget this step, you can add Python to PATH manually later.

You can check if it was successfully installed by opening your command line or terminal and typing:

.. code-block:: shell

  python --version
 
With `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_ available, install the mentioned packages from a terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install pyserial
 
Integration in Arduino IDE
--------------------------
.. note::
    We recommend to use Arduino IDE 2.0 or newer.

To install the boards, navigate to *Tools > Board > Boards Manager...* and search for *XMC*. You will see options to install the board files for the microcontrollers. 
Click *Install* to add the boards to your Arduino IDE.

Release Packages from Version 3.0.0 onwards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Certain obsolete boards and non-functional libraries were removed from the board support package for the 
release version 2.0.0, alongwith some other major changes (see `release notes <https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino/releases/tag/V2.0.0>`_). Since the release of version 3.0, the release index does not contain versions before 2.0 anymore.
