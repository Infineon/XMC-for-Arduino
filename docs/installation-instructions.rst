Installation Instructions
===========================

The following step by step guide will get you started with XMC for Arduino:

Prework for SEGGER J-Link
------------------------------

In order to use Infineon's XMC microcontroller boards in Arduino you need
`SEGGER J-Link <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink>`_ installed on your machine first. Please follow
`this link <https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink>`_ 
and install the J-Link Software and Documentation Pack for your respective operating system (OS).

Required tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
XMC-for-Arduino requires Python 3.x and pyserial. Make sure Python is installed on your machine and available in the system path.

You can check if it was successfully installed by opening your command line or terminal and typing:

.. code-block:: shell

  python --version
 
With `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_` available, install the mentioned packages from a terminal:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install pyserial
 
Integration in Arduino IDE
----------------------------
Please first download the Arduino IDE. This package is only tested for Arduino IDE 1.5 or higher. 
We recommended to use Arduino IDE 2.0 or higher.

Release packages from version 3.0.0 onwards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Certain obsolete boards (see wiki) and non-functional libraries were removed from the board support package for the 
release version 2.0.0, alongwith some other major changes (see release notes). After version 3.0.0, the release index 
will not include library before version 2.0.0.
