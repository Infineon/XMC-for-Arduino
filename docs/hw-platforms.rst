Please note that Arduino pin number 16 & 22 (SCL & A5) and Arduino pin number 15 & 21 (SDA & A4) are not connected with each other 
nor share the same pins/resources. This is different from the original Arduino UNO Rev3 implementation.

    :width: 400

The XMC1400 Kit for Arduino board consists of a XMC1400 microcontroller with a debugger implemented by a XMC4200 microcontroller.
The board shares the same power supply and board shape as other ARDUINO™ Shields.
To find out more visit the Infineon homepage of the `KIT_XMC1400_ARDUINO`_.

Pinout Diagram
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please note that pins P1.4 and P0.5 are swapped on the board and are not consistent with the silkscreen. As a result, interrupt 0 (INT0) 
occurs at Arduino pin 3 and inerrupt 1 (INT1) is located at Arduino pin 25. This is different from the original 
Arduino UNO Rev3 implementation. Please look at the pinout diagram above for more information.

.. _connected_pins:

Connected I2S and Analog pins
-------------------------------

For the KIT_XMC_PLT2GO_XMC4200, KIT_XMC_PLT2GO_XMC4400 and KIT_XMC47_RELAX_5V_AD_V1 the Arduino pin number 15 & 21 (SCL & A5) and Arduino 
pin number 14 & 20 (SDA & A4) are connected with each other on the board itself. Although they are different physical pins of the microcontroller, 
they are connected with each other on the board to comply with the original Arduino UNO Rev3 pin connections. This influences analog measurements on 
A4 and A5 if you are using I2C simultaneously. Details of the connection can also be found in the schematics in the user manual of the board here:
`KIT_XMC_PLT2GO_XMC4200 User Manual`_, `KIT_XMC_PLT2GO_XMC4400 User Manual`_ and `KIT_XMC47_RELAX_5V_AD_V1 User Manual`_.

The User Manual shows on:

* Page 11 details the 3V3 signals on connectors X1 and X2 (figure 7) including ADC channels
* Page 12 below Figure 8 details analog input specifications

A workaround is to set the I2C pins to output open drain via pinMode(<pinNumber>, OUTPUT_OPENDRAIN); and writing a HIGH afterwards via digitalWrite(<pinNumber>, HIGH); 
to turn it off if you want to use the analog pins (but then I2C cannot be used anymore). Tri-state via pinMode(<pinNumber>, XMC_GPIO_MODE_INPUT_TRISTATE); is also possible, 
but the open drain method is preferable. These functions are using the pin mode definitions from the XMC Peripheral Library defined 
`here <https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino/blob/0dcbd5822cb59d12a7bdae776d307fae9c607ed7/cores/xmc_lib/XMCLib/inc/xmc4_gpio.h#L206>`_.

You can also cut the physical connection on the board itself.

For KIT_XMC_PLT2GO_XMC4200 remove the resistor R104 and R105:
