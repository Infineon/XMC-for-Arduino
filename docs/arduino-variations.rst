Arduino Variations
====================

Functions and Options Differences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extra modes (if patches applied)
---------------------------------

This section covers the differences between standard Arduino and XMC-for-Arduino

GPIO
+++++

Extra pinMode types added that most engineers want

.. code-block:: 

    INPUT_PULLDOWN
    OUTPUT_OPENDRAIN


Extra functions (than standard Arduino AVR)
--------------------------------------------

GPIO
+++++
Does what the function names says but must have been configured as output

.. code-block:: 

    digitalToggle( pin )

Arduino Function Differences
-------------------------------

Input Mode Pins
++++++++++++++++

On standard Arduino boards, GPIO is by default either a function 
like Serial or in INPUT mode.

On XMC boards the inputs are UNDEFINED, you MUST specify every pin 
to be in INPUT Mode that needs Inputs.


Wire/I2C Differences
+++++++++++++++++++++

The method in Wire class for 'begin' is not the same as AVR Arduino, 
and has different modes for Master and Slave

In AVR Arduino setting an I2C Master or Slave

.. code-block:: 

     Wire.begin(8); // join i2c bus (address optional for master)

XMC-for-Arduino setting for I2C Master ONLY

.. code-block:: 

        Wire.begin(); // join i2c bus (address blank for master)

Currently the address is NOT optional for XMC as this currently assumes this
must be Slave mode configuration and sets the I2C configuration differently.

Tone
++++++

Number of Tone pins is determined by pins_arduino.h define NUM_TONE_PINS. 
This allows for use in other modules and for variations between boards as 
>100MHz boards can obviously handle more tone pins.

The default for XMC1xxx is 4 with a change XMC4xxxx should be 16

Tone has frequency range of maximum = 500 Hz minimum = 1 Hz

This is due to the fact that the tone frequency is software derived from 
the Systick handler, Systick has a time period of 1 ms. At maximum each 
handler event for Systick toggles a GPIO pin, so at minimum period of 1 ms 
the output is toggled, so TWO events produce one square wave cycle, therefore 
the maximum output frequency is 500Hz.

The minimum is due to the fact that tone function only accepts an unsigned 
integer (32 bit) for the frequency, so the minimum usable frequency is 1.

Standard Arduino boards use hardware timers (the few that are available) to 
generate tones and at least one timer can interfere with other functions.

However this does mean you can have more tone pins, just much lower frequency range.


Analog Functions and improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

wiring_analog after V1.2.1
-----------------------------
Analog functions like analogRead and analogWrite etc. have changed after 
V1.2.1 to have extra safety measures to ensure invalid settings cannot be 
done and report errors.

Additionally extra getter functions have been added so other libraries can 
access the resolution of read and write functions as number of bits and 
current maximum value possible.


Extra functions
----------------

These functions return the analogue resolution as number of bits

* uint8_t getAnalogReadBits( ) - range 8 to 12
* uint8_t getAnalogWriteBits( ) - range 8 to 16

These functions return the analogue resolution as its maximum value

* uint16_t getAnalogReadMaximum( ) - range 255 to 4095
* uint16_t getAnalogWriteMaximum( ) - range 255 to 65535

This function enables the analog amplifiers at the ADC inputs with 
adjustible gain (for XMC1000 series)

* uint32_t analogRead_variableGain( uint8_t channel, uint8_t gain_value )     

The gain factor values can be found :ref:`here <gain_factor>`.


Default Values
----------------

Read resolution default is 10 bits (0 to 1023)

Write resolution default is 8 bits (0 to 255)


Error and Return Codes by Function
-----------------------------------

Where possible functions do :command:`NOT` action invalid parameters passed in.

Functions return error codes or valid values so be sure which error 
code you are looking for as some functions can return 0 as a valid 
value (e.g. analogRead) so an out of range value is returned instead.

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Function
      - Valid Return
      - Errors
    * - analogReadResolution	
      - | 8 to 12
        | as passed in	
      - 255
    * - getAnalogReadBits	
      - 8 to 12
      -	none
    * - getanalogReadMaximum	
      - 255 to 4095
      -	none
    * - analogWriteResolution
      - | 8 to 16
        | as passed in	
      - 255
    * - getAnalogWriteBits	
      - 8 to 16	
      - none
    * - getanalogWriteMaximum	
      - 255 to 65535	
      - none
    * - analogRead	
      - 0 to Maximum for Resolution	
      - | 0xFFFFFFFF usually 
        | invalid channel
    * - analogWrite	
      - 0 success	
      - | -1 = invalid value
        | -2 = wrong pin
    * - setAnalogWriteFrequency
      - 0 success	
      - | -1 = invalid frequency
        | -2 = wrong pin
    * - analogReference	
      - none	
      - NULL function see below

This should enable checks in software for valid operation 
and debugging problem code.

AREF Analogue Reference
------------------------

On all boards the Analogue Reference is set to use the internal power supply 
(however noisy), so the AREF pin is an :command:`OUTPUT` of the AREF in use. 
Do :command:`NOT` connect any external voltage source to this pin, or use 
shields that change this voltage.

:command:`CAUTION` any shorts on this pin especially to 0V (GND) will bring 
down the supply 
of the chip.

The pin voltage is the current supply voltage to AREF for analogue conversions.

This pin :command:`CANNOT` be reassigned as GPIO (pinMode has no effect).

:command:`analogReference( )`

This function has NO operation and will not match any call on parameters 
passed in with other libraries or examples that use this call.

Any shields and examples that try to change this, will :command:`NOT` function 
the same on these boards.


Analog amplifiers at the ADC inputs with adjustible gain
----------------------------------------------------------
Each analog input channel can be configured to be amplified by an adjustable 
gain factor, for XMC1000 series. To configure the gain, the gain value is to 
be selected in the analogRead_variableGain() function which translates to a 
gain factor as per the following table:


.. _gain_factor:

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Gain value
      - Gain factor
    * - 0
      - 1
    * - 1
      - 3
    * - 2 
      - 6
    * - 3 
      - 12

I2C Analog pins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arduino Uno R3 format dictates that A4 and A5 are also used 
for I2C operations, so when I2C is enabled analogue inputs A4 
and A5 are NOT available.

On Arduino Uno R3 this is an alternate pin function, depending 
on which XMC-for-Arduino boards this could be an alternate pin 
function, or other case as described below.


.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Board
      - Functionality
      - Note
    * - XMC1100 Boot Kit
      - NOT supported
      - | A4 + A5 are separate
        | A6 + A7 are alternate pin 
        | configurations to I2C
    * - XMC1300 Boot Kit
      - | NOT same pin format
        | as Arduino Uno R3
      - | A10 + A11 are alternate pin
        | configurations to I2C
    * - XMC1400 Arduino Kit
      - Alternate pin function
      - Matches Arduino Uno  
    * - XMC4400 Platform 2Go
      - External hard wired pins
      - | For 3V3 boards set I2C pins to tristate or open drain to use
        | For 5V boards see Wiki board page on track cuts to enable A4 and A5 to work
        | Level shifter on the 5V board could interfere with tristate/open drain setting
    * - XMC4700 Relax Kit (and variants)
      - External hard wired pins
      - | For 3V3 boards set I2C pins to tristate or open drain to use
        | For 5V boards see Wiki board page on track cuts to enable A4 and A5 to work
        | Level shifter on the 5V board could interfere with tristate/open drain setting


Serial selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Serial Output Selection
-------------------------
On the XMC boards, two kinds of serial outputs are possible, namely:

* SERIAL DEBUG (via PC)
* SERIAL ONBOARD

If these two outputs share the same instance of the internal USIC channel, 
only one of the two could be used at a given time. The selection can be made 
via the Tools menu as shown in the picture below.

.. image:: img/serial_selection.png
    :width: 600

This is generally the case for most of the XMC boards. However, for boards 
such as the :ref:`xmc4200-platform2go` and the :ref:`xmc4700-relax`, both the serial 
output modes are simultaneously active and neednot be selected or enabled from the menu.

Note: Please note that the sketch must be recompiled when a different serial 
output is selected.

:command:`For advanced users`
The build flag -DSERIAL_HOSTPC must be used for the serial output interface 
via PC and the build flag -DSERIAL_ONBOARD must be used for serial output 
through the onboard TX and RX pins
