 *  This file defines macros indicating the type of USB controller the library is being compiled for, and its
 *  capabilities. These macros may then be referenced in the user application to selectively enable or disable
 *  code sections depending on if they are defined or not.
 *
 *  After the inclusion of the master USB driver header, one or more of the following tokens may be defined, to
 *  allow the user code to conditionally enable or disable code based on the USB controller family and allowable
 *  USB modes. These tokens may be tested against to eliminate code relating to a USB mode which is not enabled for
 *  the given compilation.
