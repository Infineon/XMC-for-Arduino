# Multiple Serial Ports Examples

Simple examples that use multiple serial ports of XMC boards to measure
distances. Uses internal functions without requiring extra libraries.

## Operation
All serial ports at 115,200 baud

If connecting other devices to serial ports it is your responsibility to make sure voltages match
### TwoPort Example
Receives from the main serial port (Serial), sends to serial port 1 (Serial1).

Receives from serial port 1 (Serial1), sends to the main serial port (Serial).

This example works only with boards with more than one serial like XMC4700 or others as 2 serial ports.

The circuit:
- Loopback RX to TX on Serial port 1 or another device
- Serial Monitor open on Serial port 0

In Loopback anything sent from Serial monitor or terminal window is echoed back after going via Serial 1. 
LEDs flash as data is received
- LED1 for Serial1
- LED2 for Serial (0)

LEDs toggle on each byte received on that port so two bytes for a flash.
